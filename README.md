## 🧠 Machine Learning Model  
- Framework: **Keras with TensorFlow**, stacking ensemble classifier combining **RandomForestClassifier** and **Logistic Regression**  
- LLM: **TinyLlama** integrated for natural language reasoning and contextual text output  
- Training Environment: Google Colab (**T4 GPU**)  
- Exported formats: `.keras`, `.joblib`, and `.gguf` (for TinyLlama)  
- Supports **CPU-only inference** (no GPU required for predictions)
